This little project is mainly about scraping from a website which contains all kind of quotes from some world famous people.And then create a game about it.

In the file "scrape_project.py" is a game about guessing which celebrity said a random quote from the website.
In the file "scrape.py" is the python code which scraped the website and load it to a csv file called "quote.csv" 
"quote.csv" contains the data scraped from the website.
 
 P.S Just ignore "name.txt" and "scarp.py". Those are from different project.
